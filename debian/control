Description: Scalable Video Technology for AV1 (SVT-AV1 Encoder and Decoder)
 The Scalable Video Technology for AV1 (SVT-AV1 Encoder and Decoder) is an
 AV1-compliant encoder/decoder library core. The SVT-AV1 encoder development
 is a work-in-progress targeting performance levels applicable to both VOD and
 Live encoding / transcoding video applications. The SVT-AV1 decoder
 implementation is targeting future codec research activities.
